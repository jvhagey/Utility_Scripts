I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of California, Davis in the animal biology graduate group. I am passionate about making "big data" in biology comprehensible and pretty. This home page will link you to my github projects. This is a new page so still under construction 👷, but no hard hat needed. I currently write most of my work in python and R. Drop me a line if you find an error or have questions!
